# Round

**Round** is a set of tools and protocol to power the contributor economy. Round enables anyone to list work on-chain with attached rewards on the Ethereum blockchain (also, on some EVM compatible chains). We've seen how round-based engagement has brought communities to life in the Nouns ecosystem. We've also been inspired and are using some of the contracts defined by the StandardBounties project as we evolve the Round protocol.

There are many advantages to putting requests for work on-chain as rounds:
- Rounds can be listed and completed through different marketplaces and tools
- Rewards can be held in smart contracts that are released as soon as work is completed
- We contribute towards more detailed and immutable records of work on-chain beyond badging systems

In addition, onchain Rounds enable new use cases, like the ability for multiple parties to fund work towards a community good. 

**We believe that in order for work to happen at Internet speed, it needs to be enabled by fluid and instant payments on blockchains.**

These docs will cover the following:
- [Product Guides](/product-guides): User guides for some tools we've built on the protocol
- [Protocol Overview](/protocol): How the protocol works, and how to build on it  

Please note these docs are a very active work in progress, and if you have any immediate questions, [hop into the Discord](https://discord.gg/JKjY5tmvSu) or DM us on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/launchround). FYI: Round was previous named Aikido - so you might see references to Aikido in these docs and in the product. Apologies while we clean up during our rebrand.
