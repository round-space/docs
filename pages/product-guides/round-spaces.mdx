# Round Spaces

If you're managing a lot of rounds with your community, you can manage them using Round Spaces.

## Connecting Your wallet

Like most Web3 Dapps, Round Spaces uses your Ethereum wallet as your primary identifier. If you want to use a Multisig wallet, try out our [Gnosis Safe App](/product-guides/gnosis-safe-app). 

The protocol has been deployed to a variety of other EVM compatible chains, so if you want to set up rounds on those chains, use one of the following:

- [Goerli Testnet](https://goerli.round.space)
- [Polygon](https://polygon.round.space)
- [Mumbai Testnet](https://mumbai.round.space)

## Setting up your Space

Start by setting some metadata for your board. You can change this information later by going to [https://www.round.space/dashboard/settings](https://www.round.space/dashboard/settings). You will also be able to customize other board settings, like a Twitter or Discord link for your community. If there is other metadata you would like to see,

## Managing Your Space

All rounds that are created with your wallet appear on your round space. **rounds created on [round.new](https://round.new) with the same wallet will appear here too.** You have the option of hiding draft rounds from the space in your Space settings.

## Creating a New Round

When you click "Create a Round", you will see a form to create a new on-chain round. Note that this is a little different than the round.new wizard, but you can do all the same things.
