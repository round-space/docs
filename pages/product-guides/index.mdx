# Product Guides

You can use Round through different products:
* [round.new](/round-wizard): A tool to create individual onchain rounds
* [round.space](/round-space): A tool to create branded spaces for your DAO or community.

## Launching a Round

Creating a round is a simple form with the following required fields:
- Title (keep this short and easy to understand)
- Description (a clear description of deliverables)
- Reward: in ETH or any ERC20 token. 
- Deadline: The date the round will close (i.e no new submissions allowed)

Additionally, you have the option to:
- Accept Applications: Specify whether your round requires a pre-application (useful for bigger tasks and grant programs)
- Accept Additional Funding: Specify whether anyone can add additional funds to a round (e.g. to sponsor or support the work)

Once your round is created, you will be redirected to the page for the round at the URL `www.round.space/round/[round-id]`.

## Accepting submissions

Once your round is created, share the round page with your community to accept submissions. Submitters have two options:
- Propose to a Round directly
- Apply for a Round with some details. This is optional, and only happens if an issuer selects "Require Application" when creating a round. 

Submissions and claims happen "off-chain", which means submitters do not have to pay any gas fees for working on your round.

## Rewarding Contributors

To accept a contribution, press "Accept" next to the Submission and a dialog will appear allowing you to specify the amount to reward. You can choose to reward the entire round, or a partial amount (for example, for a milestone payment or if you want to reward multiple users).

## Accepting Funds

Bounties can be set to accept additional funding in the original token of the round (this is an option during the in the [create screen](/product-guides/#creating-a-bounty)). If enabled, users will see a "Fund this round" button on the page, which will allow them to add funds to the round pot. Note that all control of the round approval still lies with the issuer and approvers.
