# Product Guides

You can use Aikido through different products:
* [bounty.new](/bounty-wizard): A tool to create individual on-chain bounties
* [aikido.work](/bounty-boards): A tool to create branded bounty boards for your DAO, open source project or community.

## Creating a Bounty

Creating a bounty is a simple form with the following required fields:
- Title (keep this short and easy to understand)
- Description (a clear description of deliverables and a "definition of done")
- Reward: in ETH or any ERC20 token. 
- Deadline: The date the bounty will close (i.e no new submissions allowed)

Additionally, you have the option to:
- Accept Applications: Specify whether your bounty requires a pre-application (useful for bigger tasks and grant programs)
- Accept Additional Funding: Specify whether anyone can add additional funds to a bounty (e.g. to sponsor or support the work)

Once your bounty is created, you will be redirected to the page for the bounty at the URL `www.aikido.work/bounty/[bounty-id]`.

## Accepting submissions

Once your bounty is created, share the bounty page with your community to accept submissions. Submitters have two options:
- Claim a bounty directly, with a submission as a proof of work.
- Apply for a Bounty with details about them. This is optional, and only happens if an issuer selects "Require Application" when creating a bounty. 

Submissions and claims happen "off-chain", which means submitters do not have to pay any gas fees for working on your bounty.

## Rewarding Contributors

To accept a contribution, press "Accept" next to the Submission and a dialog will appear allowing you to specify the amount to reward. You can choose to reward the entire bounty, or a partial amount (for example, for a milestone payment or if you want to reward multiple users).

## Accepting Funds

Bounties can be set to accept additional funding in the original token of the bounty (this is an option during the in the [create screen](/product-guides/#creating-a-bounty)). If enabled, users will see a "Fund this Bounty" button on the page, which will allow them to add funds to the bounty pot. Note that all control of the bounty approval still lies with the issuer and approvers.
