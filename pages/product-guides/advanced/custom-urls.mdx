# Custom URLs

When you set up a workspace on Round, the default URL is either your Ethereum address, or your ENS (if one exists for that address). Now, you can also create a custom URL for your project workspace, making it easier to share with your community and preserving privacy of your wallet address. A custom URL might look something like `round.space/space/ethereum`. 

To claim a custom URL, simply go to your Board Settings > Custom URL.

A few notes:
* Custom URLs are backwards compatible - so even if a custom URL exists, the URL with the wallet address (`round.space/space/0x12345`) or ENS (`round.space/space/bob.eth`) will still resolve to the board, preserving any existing links.
* For now, round.space and polygon.round.space are different workspaces and therefore have their own custom URLs. So, if `bob.eth` creates a custom URL on www.round.space, this will not reflect on polygon.round.space unless they explictly set up a Polygon workspace.
