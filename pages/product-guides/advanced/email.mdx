# Email Notifications

Email notifications are sent (optionally) for specific events in the workflow of a bounty when using Round.

Notifications sent to round issuers:
- When a contributor claims an active round
- When a contributor applies to an active round

Notifications sent to round contributors:
- When an issuer accepts a round application
- When an issuer accepts round claim(s), and any payment is released

Email notifications to issuers are optional - i.e. they are only sent if they choose to add an email to their workspace.
