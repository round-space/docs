# Email Subscriptions

You can now subscribe to any workspace on Round with your email, and instantly notify your contributor network of new opportunities as soon as they are posted on-chain. 

Workspace Subscriptions are a great way for contributors to stay up to date with the project opportunities they care about most. Anyone can start building a contributor network around their workspace without having any opportunities posted.

Emails require a wallet signature and need to be verified before sending. Email data is stored off-chain and uses Sendgrid for all deliveries. We absolutely will never spam or sell your email.
